Yatzy calculator program.

You should pass dice rolls to standard input, formatted as one roll of five dice followed by the category to score:

1,2,3,4,5 <category>
1,2,2,3,3 <category>

where <category> should be one of:

[chance, yatzy, ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, pair, threeofakind, fourofakind, smallstraight, largestraight, twopairs, fullhouse]

This program will then print the calculated score to standard output, and any error messages to standard error.
